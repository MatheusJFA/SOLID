The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

The Dependency Inversion Principle is the D in SOLID. It is a design principle that states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions.
This means that the implementation details of low-level modules should be hidden behind abstractions, so that high-level modules can depend on those abstractions rather than on the low-level modules themselves.
This helps to decouple high-level and low-level modules, making the codebase more flexible, maintainable, and testable.

The Dependency Inversion Principle can be achieved by using interfaces or abstract classes to define the abstractions that high-level modules depend on.
Low-level modules can then implement those interfaces or extend those abstract classes, allowing high-level modules to interact with them through the abstractions.

For example, if a high-level module needs to interact with a low-level module that reads data from a database, the low-level module could implement an interface that defines the methods for reading data.
The high-level module could then depend on that interface, rather than on the low-level module itself, allowing it to interact with any low-level module that implements the interface.

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle, codebases can be more flexible, maintainable, and testable, which can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
