The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

The Liskov Substitution Principle is the L in SOLID. It is a design principle that states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
This means that a subclass should be able to be substituted for its superclass without changing the behavior of the program.
This is important because it allows for polymorphism, which can make code more flexible and reusable.

The Liskov Substitution Principle can be achieved by following these guidelines:
1. The subclass should implement all of the methods of the superclass.
2. The subclass should not override any of the methods of the superclass.
3. The subclass should not throw any new exceptions that are not thrown by the superclass.
4. The subclass should not change the behavior of any of the methods of the superclass.

By following the Liskov Substitution Principle, classes can be more flexible, reusable, and maintainable, which can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
