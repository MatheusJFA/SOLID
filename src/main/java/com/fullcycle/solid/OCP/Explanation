The Open Close Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

The Open Close Principle is the O in SOLID. It is a design principle that states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.
This is important because it allows for new functionality to be added to a class without changing the existing code, which can help prevent bugs and other issues.

The Open Close Principle can be achieved by using inheritance, composition, and interfaces.

Inheritance: By creating a new class that extends the existing class, new functionality can be added without modifying the existing class.
Composition: By creating a new class that contains an instance of the existing class, new functionality can be added without modifying the existing class.
Interfaces: By defining an interface that the existing class implements, new functionality can be added by creating a new class that implements the interface.

By following the Open Close Principle, classes can be more flexible, reusable, and maintainable, which can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
