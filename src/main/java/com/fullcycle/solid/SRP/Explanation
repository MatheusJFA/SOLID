The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change.

The Single Responsibility Principle is the S in SOLID. It is a design principle that states that a class should have only one reason to change.
This means that a class should have only one responsibility or job, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within the class.
This is important because it helps to keep classes small, focused, and easy to understand, which can make them easier to maintain and test.

The Single Responsibility Principle can be achieved by breaking up large classes into smaller classes that each have a single responsibility.

For example, if a class is responsible for both reading and writing data to a file, it could be broken up into two separate classes: one for reading data and one for writing data.
This would make each class easier to understand and maintain, and would also make it easier to test each class independently.

By following the Single Responsibility Principle, classes can be more modular, reusable, and maintainable, which can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
