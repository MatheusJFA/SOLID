The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement methods it does not use.

The Interface Segregation Principle is the I in SOLID. It is a design principle that states that a class should not be forced to implement methods it does not use.
This means that interfaces should be small and focused, with only the methods that are relevant to the class that implements them.
This is important because it can help to reduce the complexity of classes and make them easier to understand and maintain.

The Interface Segregation Principle can be achieved by following these guidelines:
1. Create small, focused interfaces that contain only the methods that are relevant to the class that implements them.
2. Use multiple interfaces to break up large interfaces into smaller, more focused ones.
3. Avoid creating interfaces with too many methods, as this can make them difficult to implement and maintain.

By following the Interface Segregation Principle, classes can be more flexible, reusable, and maintainable, which can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
